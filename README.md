# Quarto Website Template

This repository serves as a template for creating a website rendered from markdown files using Quarto. It provides a starting point for building a website with Quarto. 

To individualize content, change the following:

1. state project information in this [`README.md`](/README.md)
2. individualize content of the main (starting) page in [`index.qmd`](/index.qmd) 
3. (optionally) add futher content in additional pages ([`subpage.qmd`](/subpage.qmd) is initialized as starting point)
4. customize content in the [`_quarto.yml`](/_quarto.yml) file
   - change `site_url`, `repo_url` and under *page footer* `href` to point to the new repo
   - (optionally) change all the other links pointing to personal social media sites etc.
   - (optionally) add additional pages such as `subpage`
5. (optionally) change the style of the website (fonts, colors,...) in the [`custom_theme.scss`](/custom_theme.scss) file. 


The website is rendered with Quarto either locally (has to be installed) or in Github automatically each time new content is added/changed via Github Actions to the `_site` folder, do not change anything in there.
